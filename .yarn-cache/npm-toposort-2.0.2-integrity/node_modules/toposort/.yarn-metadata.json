An edge looks like this: `[node1, node2]` (vertices needn't be strings but can be of any type).\n\nReturns: {Array} a list of vertices, sorted from \"start\" to \"end\"\n\nThrows an error if there are any cycles in the graph.\n\n### toposort.array(nodes, edges)\n\n+ nodes {Array} An array of nodes\n+ edges {Array} An array of directed edges. You don't need to mention all `nodes` here.\n\nThis is a convenience method that allows you to define nodes that may or may not be connected to any other nodes. The ordering of unconnected nodes is not defined.\n\nReturns: {Array} a list of vertices, sorted from \"start\" to \"end\"\n\nThrows an error if there are any cycles in the graph.\n\n## Tests\n\nRun the tests with `node test.js`.\n\n## Legal\n\nMIT License\n",
