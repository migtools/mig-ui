That's fine but it's hard to keep\non track of different outputs. Also if one process fails, others still keep running\nand you won't even notice the difference.\n\nAnother option would be to just run all commands in separate terminals. I got\ntired of opening terminals and made **concurrently**.\n\n**Features:**\n\n* Cross platform (including Windows)\n* Output is easy to follow with prefixes\n* With `--kill-others` switch, all commands are killed if one dies\n* Spawns commands with [spawn-command](https://github.com/mmalecki/spawn-command)\n\n## Install\n\nThe tool is written in Node.js, but you can use it to run **any** commands.\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g concurrently\n```\n\nor if you are using it from npm scripts:\n\n```bash\nnpm install concurrently --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nRemember to surround separate commands with quotes:\n```bash\nconcurrently \"command1 arg\" \"command2 arg\"\n```\n\nOtherwise **concurrently** would try to run 4 separate commands:\n`command1`, `arg`, `command2`, `arg`.\n\nIn package.json, escape quotes:\n\n```bash\n\"start\": \"concurrently \\\"command1 arg\\\" \\\"command2 arg\\\"\"\n```\n\nNPM run commands can be shortened:\n\n```bash\nconcurrently \"npm:watch-js\" \"npm:watch-css\" \"npm:watch-node\"\n\n# Equivalent to:\nconcurrently -n watch-js,watch-css,watch-node \"npm run watch-js\" \"npm run watch-css\" \"npm run watch-node\"\n```\n\nNPM shortened commands also support wildcards. Given the following scripts in\npackage.json:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    //...\n    \"scripts\": {\n        // ...\n        \"watch-js\": \"...\",\n        \"watch-css\": \"...\",\n        \"watch-node\": \"...\",\n        // ...\n    },\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n```bash\nconcurrently \"npm:watch-*\"\n\n# Equivalent to:\nconcurrently -n js,css,node \"npm run watch-js\" \"npm run watch-css\" \"npm run watch-node\"\n\n# Any name provided for the wildcard command will be used as a prefix to the wildcard\n# part of the script name:\nconcurrently -n w: npm:watch-*\n\n# Equivalent to:\nconcurrently -n w:js,w:css,w:node \"npm run watch-js\" \"npm run watch-css\" \"npm run watch-node\"\n```\n\nGood frontend one-liner example [here](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/dont-copy-paste-this-frontend-template/blob/5cd2bde719654941bdfc0a42c6f1b8e69ae79980/package.json#L9).\n\nHelp:\n\n```\n\nconcurrently [options] <command ...>\n\nGeneral\n  -m, --max-processes  How many processes should run at once.\n                       New processes only spawn after all restart tries of a\n                       process.

Default: `process.stdout`.\n    - `prefix`: the prefix type to use when logging processes output.\n      Possible values: `index`, `pid`, `time`, `command`, `name`, `none`, or a template (eg `[{time} process: {pid}]`).\n      Default: the name of the process, or its index if no name is set.\n    - `prefixLength`: how many characters to show when prefixing with `command`. Default: `10`\n    - `raw`: whether raw mode should be used, meaning strictly process output will\n    be logged, without any prefixes, colouring or extra stuff.\n    - `successCondition`: the condition to consider the run was successful.\n    If `first`, only the first process to exit will make up the success of the run; if `last`, the last process that exits will determine whether the run succeeds.\n    Anything else means all processes should exit successfully.\n    - `restartTries`: how many attempts to restart a process that dies will be made. Default: `0`.\n    - `restartDelay`: how many milliseconds to wait between process restarts. Default: `0`.\n    - `timestampFormat`: a [date-fns format](https://date-fns.org/v2.0.1/docs/format)\n    to use when prefixing with `time`. Default: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.ZZZ`\n\n> Returns: a `Promise` that resolves if the run was successful (according to `successCondition` option),\n> or rejects, containing an array of objects with information for each command that has been run, in the order\n> that the commands terminated. The objects have the shape `{ command, index, exitCode }`, where `command` is the object\n> passed in the `commands` array and `index` its index there. Default values (empty strings or objects) are returned for\n> the fields that were not specified.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst concurrently = require('concurrently');\nconcurrently([\n    'npm:watch-*',\n    { command: 'nodemon', name: 'server' },\n    { command: 'deploy', name: 'deploy', env: { PUBLIC_KEY: '...' } }\n], {\n    prefix: 'name',\n    killOthers: ['failure', 'success'],\n    restartTries: 3,\n}).then(success, failure);\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n* Process exited with code *null*?\n\n    From [Node child_process documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_event_exit), `exit` event:\n\n    > This event is emitted after the child process ends. If the process\n    > terminated normally, code is the final exit code of the process,\n    > otherwise null. If the process terminated due to receipt of a signal,\n    > signal is the string name of the signal, otherwise null.\n\n\n    So *null* means the process didn't terminate normally. This will make **concurrent**\n    to return non-zero exit code too.\n\n* Does this work with the npm-replacements [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/)?\n\n    Yes! In all examples above, you may replace \"`npm`\" with \"`yarn`\" or \"`pnpm`\".\n",
