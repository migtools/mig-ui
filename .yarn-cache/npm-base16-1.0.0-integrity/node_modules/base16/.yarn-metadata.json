This repository is just a JS mirror of [base16-builder schemes](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder/tree/master/schemes).\n\nThe original work in creating JS counterparts was performed by [@dzannotti](https://github.com/dzannotti) as part of his work on [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools). All I did was extract them into a separate repository.\n",
