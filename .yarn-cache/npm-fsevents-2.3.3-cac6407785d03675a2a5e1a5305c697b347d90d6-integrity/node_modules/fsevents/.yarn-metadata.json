    "readme": "# fsevents\n\nNative access to MacOS FSEvents in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)\n\nThe FSEvents API in MacOS allows applications to register for notifications of\nchanges to a given directory tree. It is a very fast and lightweight alternative\nto kqueue.\n\nThis is a low-level library. For a cross-platform file watching module that\nuses fsevents, check out [Chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar).\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh\nnpm install fsevents\n```\n\nSupports only **Node.js v8.16 and higher**.\n\n```js\nconst fsevents = require('fsevents');\n\n// To start observation\nconst stop = fsevents.watch(__dirname, (path, flags, id) => {\n  const info = fsevents.getInfo(path, flags);\n});\n\n// To end observation\nstop();\n```\n\n> **Important note:** The API behaviour is slightly different from typical JS APIs. The `stop` function **must** be\n> retrieved and stored somewhere, even if you don't plan to stop the watcher. If you forget it, the garbage collector\n> will eventually kick in, the watcher will be unregistered, and your callbacks won't be called anymore.\n\nThe callback passed as the second parameter to `.watch` get's called whenever the operating system detects a\na change in the file system. It takes three arguments:\n\n###### `fsevents.watch(dirname: string, (path: string, flags: number, id: string) => void): () => Promise<undefined>`\n\n * `path: string` - the item in the filesystem that have been changed\n * `flags: number` - a numeric value describing what the change was\n * `id: string` - an unique-id identifying this specific event\n\n Returns closer callback which when called returns a Promise resolving when the watcher process has been shut down.\n\n###### `fsevents.getInfo(path: string, flags: number, id: string): FsEventInfo`\n\nThe `getInfo` function takes the `path`, `flags` and `id` arguments and converts those parameters into a structure\nthat is easier to digest to determine what the change was.\n\nThe `FsEventsInfo` has the following shape:\n\n```js\n/**\n * @typedef {'created'|'modified'|'deleted'|'moved'|'root-changed'|'cloned'|'unknown'} FsEventsEvent\n * @typedef {'file'|'directory'|'symlink'} FsEventsType\n */\n{\n  \"event\": \"created\", // {FsEventsEvent}\n  \"path\": \"file.txt\",\n  \"type\": \"file\",    // {FsEventsType}\n  \"changes\": {\n    \"inode\": true,   // Had iNode Meta-Information changed\n    \"finder\": false, // Had Finder Meta-Data changed\n    \"access\": false, // Had access permissions changed\n    \"xattrs\": false  // Had xAttributes changed\n  },\n  \"flags\": 0x100000000\n}\n```\n\n## Changelog\n\n- v2.3 supports Apple Silicon ARM CPUs\n- v2 supports node 8.16+ and reduces package size massively\n- v1.2.8 supports node 6+\n- v1.2.7 supports node 4+\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- I'm getting `EBADPLATFORM` `Unsupported platform for fsevents` error.\n- It's fine, nothing is broken. fsevents is macos-only. Other platforms are skipped. If you want to hide this warning, report a bug to NPM bugtracker asking them to hide ebadplatform warnings by default.\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License Copyright (C) 2010-2020 by Philipp Dunkel, Ben Noordhuis, Elan Shankar, Paul Miller — see LICENSE file.\n\nVisit our [GitHub page](https://github.com/fsevents/fsevents) and [NPM Page](https://npmjs.org/package/fsevents)\n",
